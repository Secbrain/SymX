# Examples of security analysis reports

This folder includes three detailed contract analysis reports and three simplified contract analysis reports. From these two report types, we can know *the details of RSymX 18 security detectors*. Note that the difference between simplified and detailed is that the results of the detectors outputting secure are not displayed in the simplified report. That is, the simplified reports mainly focuses on briefing the contracts' problems, thereby reducing the time for auditors to read the reports. Nonetheless, vulnerabilities that do not exist in contracts illustrated in the detailed reports can alert owners to develop the contracts with specifications in the future.
